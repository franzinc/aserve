	* examples/examples.cl - add commentary to some of the links
	to make them clearer

2001-09-20  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>

2001-09-12  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.8
	* client.cl: add :skip-body to do-http-request. add test for this.
	* decode.cl: fix form-urlencoded-to-query so that it can
		handle a non simple string (which can be returned under
	        certain circumstances from get-request-body)

2001-08-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.7
	* take the default value for the external-format
	  argument from *default-aserve-external-format*.  
	  net.aserve:start sets the value of *default-aserve-external-foramt*
	  in worker threads.

	* parse.cl (split-string): don't get confused by commas inside
		a double quoted header parameter value.

2001-08-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* main.cl - try harder to prevent debug output from multiple
	    threads from getting jumbled up on the console
	* publish.cl - do a keep-alive connection if the data is a binary
	    stream as long as we know the content length.
	    Add a new internal entity type so that returns of 
	    "304 - Not Modified" can do keep alives too.

2001-08-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.5

	*  test/t-aserve.cl - test filters in publish-directory

2001-08-08  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  publish.cl - allow list of index files to be specified in
		for each directory-entity.
	    - specify a catch-all compute-response-stream method so 
	      users adding new entity type don't have to do so.

2001-08-08  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* publish.cl - fix for when no body is given with-http-body
		and thus a string-output-stream is not created.

2001-07-30    <jkf@DEEDEE>
1.2.4
	* main.cl: fix get-multipart-* to correspond to rfc2046
		and thus it will work with the Opera browser which 
		generates legal (but unusual) kinds of boundary markers

2001-07-19  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.3
	* publish.cl

	* example/chat.cl - add chat transcript feature


2001-06-27  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.2.2
	* added the ability to filter requests before they get 
	  processed.  see Request-Filters in aserve.html

2001-06-26  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.1
	* main.cl - don't get blocked on a force-output that will
	    never return due to the other side of the connection 
	    going away.
	* examples/chat.cl - support private chats amoung groups of
	    people.  Support deleting messages. Support levels
	    of users. Support redirecting
	    people at certain IP addresses away from the chat if
	    they cause problems.

2001-06-05  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.0
	* main.cl - update version to 1.2.0 to mark acl 6.1 release.

2001-04-04  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* changed how publish-directory deals with urls that
	  point to directories and not files.  It used to 
	  pretend that you specified an index.html or index.htm
	  file in that directory.  This was bad since relative urls
	  in the index file would not be processed correctly. with
	  the change it now redirects to the index.html or index.htm
	  file so that the browser knows what it's getting.

2001-03-22  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.41
	* add os-processes argument to net.aserve:start 
	 which causes aserve to fork (on unix only) and create
	 multiple operating system processes listening on the
	 same port.
	

2001-02-08  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.40
	* added the proxy-proxy argument to net.aserve:start that
	  permits you to specify that the allegroserve proxy should
	  sent its requests through another proxy. 

2001-02-06  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.39
	* proxy and scanning fixes

2001-01-22  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.38
	* main.cl: incf version.  Also hooks added for links scanning.

2001-01-18  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* examples/urian.cl - new international character set demo
	    (reachable from the main aserve examples page)

2001-01-02  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.1.37
	* main.cl, proxy.cl - add the ability to save and restore
	 the whole state of the proxy cache. (see docs for start
	 and shutdown in the manual).
    
        * ensure that proxy cache threads are killed off when a shutdown
	  is done.
	
>>>     incompatible change: the net.aserve:shutdown function used to
	take an optional argument.  Now it takes keyword arguments.
	
2000-12-27  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.36
	* client.cl: handle illegal set-cookie headers sent by Netscape's
	  v3 web server.  In a client request Split the single large 
	  Cookie line into muliple Cookie lines so that Netscape's v3
	  web server can understand them.
	  Add a redirect-methods argument to do-http-request to support
	  more user control of redirection.
	* proxy.cl - many enhancements including connection caching

2000-11-06  Kevin Layer  <layer@ultra>
1.1.35
	* log.cl: make logmess a method, so I can define an after method
	on it in my own code
	* main.cl: maybe-universal-time-to-date and
	universal-time-to-date: take time-zone optional argument, so my
	redefined version of log-request can specify the local time zone

2000-10-31  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.34
	* add to the list of characters to escape in form-urlencoding
	  those that must be escaped so that the result can be put
	  in the query string of a uri

	* in proxy code write request and headers in one big block
	  to get around bug in IP redirectors (such as found in www.cbs.com)

2000-10-25  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.1.33
	* hooks for link checking and experimenting with caching

2000-10-19  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.32
	* add ssl arguments to net.aserve.start and
	  net.aserve.client:do-http-request so that a secure server
	  can be started and secure http requests can be made.
	  Make the aserve test suite test run though the tests using ssl.
	  Note: the ssl module is only present in certain acl6 distributoins.
	
	* add examples/puzzle.cl  - a demo featuring the use of international
	  characters in acl6.
	
2000-10-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

2000-09-22  Charles A. Cox  <cox@pie>

	* decode.cl: Add :external-format to to uriencode-string.
	* publish.cl: Add :external-format to set-cookie-header.
	* test/t-aserve.cl: Add :external-format tests for
	uri{en,de}code-string.

2000-09-07  Charles A. Cox  <cox@delta>
1.1.29
	
>>>	Note: Many of the functions listed in this log entry have had
	the :external-format argument added.  Documentation has been
	updated

	Note 2:  All changes intended to be upward compatible.  Allegro
	specific changes are marked with #+(and allegro (version>= 6 0)).
	
	*  client.cl: make-http-client-request: add/use external-format
	argument.
	*  decode.cl: uridecode-string, query-to-form-urlencoded,
	encode-form-urlencode, form-urlencoded-to-query: add/use
	external-format argument.
	*  main.cl: with-http-body, request-query: add/use external-format
	argument.
	*  publish.cl: get-cookie-values: add/use external-format
	argument.
	*  examples/examples.cl: Add new international character examples.
	*  test/t-aserve.cl: Add tests for external-format additions.


2000-08-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.28
	* client.cl - before doing a redirect close down the existing
	    connection.

2000-08-25  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* fix bug which caused file descriptors to remain open
	  forever if a "connection reset by peer" error occured.
	  Added the ability to track sockets opened by aserve to
	  ensure that they were closed before being gc'ed away.

2000-08-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.27
	* rewrote the get-multipart-xxx functions to use an
	  (unsigned-byte 8) buffer since character buffers have
	  issues with international code.   This eliminates the
	  extra <cr><lf> at the end problem with get-multipart-sequence.
	  The file transfer should be faster, especially if you 
	  pass get-multipart-sequence a 4096 byte (unsigned-byte 8) vector.
	
	  !! Eliminte the raw argument from get-multipart-sequence. Now
	  transfers are all 'raw'
	  If a character array is passed to get-multipart-sequence then
	  we just copy into each character the code-char of the 
	  item in the buffer (which corresponds to the latin1-base
	  external format).  We will allow external-format select
	  soon.
	  

2000-08-21  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  add :proxy arg to net.aserve:start so you can enable the proxy
	   when you start the server.
	*  fix test suite to report only legit errors

2000-08-20  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.1.26
	*  Added a proxy capability.  enable-proxy will turn it on.
	   Currently it acts an http/1.0 client and server since that
	   makes it easier to debug. However this does cause 12 test
	   set errors to be reported since it expects to see http/1.1
	   responses. 

2000-08-17  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  implement generalized cons-free header parsing and use it
	   in both the client and server.

	* change the header info returned by do-http-request to
	  also use keywords to describe headers
	  !! non upward compatiable change !!

2000-08-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  fix bug where certain headers were sent twice

2000-08-12  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  name headers by keyword symbols rather than strings
	  !! this change is not upward compatible !!
	
    
2000-08-10  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.25
	*  decode.cl: request-query will now convert items in query
	    strings without values into ("keyname" . "") in the resulting
	    alist.
	*  doc/aserve.html - update doc of request-query and 
	   request-query-value to reflect what happens with null valued
	   query elements

2000-08-09  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  publish.cl: write the transfer encoding as all lowercase 'chunked'
	   since a bug in Mozilla M17 means it will only understand this form.
	*  htmlgen/htmlgen.cl - add the <caption> tag

2000-08-04  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.1.24
	*  examples/chat.cl - add user logins and private messages 
	        between users.

2000-07-31  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  main.cl: if a multipart-mixed body was being sent then
	    note that the request-body has been grabbed.

2000-07-25  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  example/chat.cl - enhanced to support logging into the chat

2000-07-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.22
	
	*  main.cl: incf version 

2000-07-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  examples/chat.cl - sample program that does web based chat

2000-07-14  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* client.cl - now do-http-request will always return a uri object
	    (previously it would return its uri arg unless a redirect
             was done in which case it would return a uri object)

2000-07-01  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* client.cl - handle the "100 continue" response we seem to 
	 get from IIS whenever we do a post.

2000-06-25  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* keep track all of all ip addresses by which the server
	  is contacted (this is simpler than trying to figure them
	  out in advance).
	* add function to find a response object given the code.
	* keep track of the raw uri by which a request was made
	  (as distinguished from the uri in which we've added the
	  host and port values).  This is necessary to distriguish
	  when we must proxy.
	* in html-print assume that attribute values are already html escaped

2000-06-12  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* main.cl: add utility function request-query-value to
		combine getting the query info via request query
		and locating the particular value with assoc

2000-06-08  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.21
	* client.cl - do-http-request: 
	        1. give the redirect arg a numeric
		   value to prevent infinite redirect loops.
	        2. handle two other redirect codes
		3. autoredirect only for get and head
		4. return the uri accessed as the fourth value
	* main.cl - add more response codes
		- handle calls to request-query specifying different
		 uri and post values.
	* examples.cl - add redirect test
	* t-aserve.cl - test redirection
	* doc/aserve.html  - update for changes above
	* doc/tutorial.html - don't be so cookie centric

2000-05-30  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.20
	* macs.cl - add note about where to find the if* macro
	* main.cl - cache result of get-request-body so that it can
		    safely be called more than once inside a response
	            function.   Also be sure to call get-request-body 
	            if the connection is keep-alive and there might 
	            be a body following the headers.
	* t-aserve.cl - test enhancment to get-request-body
	* doc/aserve.html - fix do-http-request documentation to
	            reflect change made in 1.1.18
	            

	
Fri May 26 22:42:12 PST 2000  Duane Rettig  <duane@beta>
1.1.19
	* makefile: set SHELL variable
	* main.cl: incf version
	
2000-05-16  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.18	
	* ! Non upward-compatiable change ! - the function
	   do-http-request returns arguments in a different
	   order, it now returns the body value first, then the
	   response code and then the headers.
	* fixed bug in publish-directory (sourceforge bug 105426)
	* added query and content-type arguments to do-http-request
	  and make-http-client-request.  These make it even easier
	  to send form data to web servers
	
	
2000-05-16  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.17


	* in order to make portions of the LGPL license meaningful
	  for a Lisp program we've added a prequel to the license
	  agreement in the file license-allegroserve.txt.

2000-05-16  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* client.cl
	  - increase header reading buffer size - but we should
	    make this growable.
	  - handle cookies with = signs embedded
	* decode.cl 
	  - in query-to-form-urlencoded all the values to
	    be non-strings and in that case use ~a format to stringify them
        * parse.cl 
	  - add arg to utility function
	
2000-05-04  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.16
	* request-query can now read from uri and/or post'ed body
	  see doc/aserve.html for details

2000-04-26  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.15
	* ! Non upward-compatible change ! -- the function
	    decode-form-urlencoded has been renamed
	    form-urlencoded-to-query so as to match its new inverse
	    function: query-to-form-urlencoded

	* added query-to-form-urlencoded to allow one to encode
	  query to strings for use by client code.

2000-04-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.14
	* verify that it works in acl501 trial (Linux)

2000-04-24    <jkf@CROW>

	* load.cl: make aServe load in acl5.0.1 Lite (Windows) but
	   be advised that it doesn't work very well due to socket
	   problems that can be patched in the Lite version.

	* main.cl: the default timeout for a with-http-response
		now comes from *http-response-timeout* and it
		now defaults to 120 seconds rather than 60.
	
	* some documention updates

2000-04-23  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* client.cl - added proxy argument so that client requests
	    can go through a proxy
	* various doc fixes

2000-04-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.13
	* rename Allegro iServe to AllegroServe.
	  As a result where iserve was used before we now use aserve.
	  For example the package is now called net.aserve.


2000-04-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.12

	* add test/t-iserve.cl to the list of files in the ftp distribution

2000-04-16    <jkf@DEEDEE>

	* debug-on and debug-off are no longer exported symbols.
	  They continue to exist but you have to use
          net.iserve::debug-on and net.iserve::debug-off to reach them.

	* added two new response type symbols to aid in doing redirections:
	    *response-moved-permanently*
	    *response-temporary-redirect*
	  note that netscape 4 doesn't understand *response-temporary-redirect*
          as that's a http/1.1 thing.
	
	* request-query takes a :handle-post keyword arguments.  When true
	  (and that's the default) it will automatically read,
	  extract, parse and cache the query string from the entity body
	  when the request is a post request.
	  
2000-03-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* move htmlgen.html from htmlgen/ to doc/ so that it's in
	  a consistent place regardless of distribution type.

2000-04-08    <jkf@DEEDEE>
1.1.11
	* make the debugging output feature based rather than
	  numeric. see  net.iserve:debug-on
	* properly do client queries
	* use setfable reply-header-slot-value to read and set 
	  headers for the reply that will be sent
	* always send back HTTP/1.1 as our protocol

	
2000-03-27  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.10

	  to allow you to add headers
	* fix client requests for :head so it doesn't wait for a body
	  to be returned
	* fix debugging output when running inside emacs
	* add client info to documentation.
	
2000-03-27  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.9

	* mainly documentation fixes

2000-03-22  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.8
	* fix http/0.9 processing
	
	* make errors in http worker threads, if uncaught (see below)
	  and if the emacs-lisp interface is running, cause a new
	  emacs window to appear in which you can debug the problem
	
	* add net.iserve::*trap-errors* (default t).  If set to
	  nil then errors in http processing by iserve will result
	  in error break loops.

	* fixed errors in publish-directory.  Also prevent user from
	passing ../ in urls to access above the published directory
	
2000-03-22  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
